I developed a 3-layer neural network from scratch, implementing logistic and softmax regression for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. Through custom sigmoid function and gradient descent algorithm, I optimized model training, achieving 71.3% accuracy on test data validated against a cross-validation set. The project outcomes, methodologies, and comprehensive video examples were demonstrated and documented to contribute to the machine learning community. Engaging in iterative testing and refinement, I explored neural network architecture and optimization techniques to enhance model performance and reliability.
